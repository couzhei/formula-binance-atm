# Formula Binance ATM

Formula Binance ATM is a modular Python and TypeScript project that combines a trading signals backtesting engine, a FastAPI backend, and a Next.js-powered crypto charting interface. It also includes an advanced RSS reader with Windows service support for notifications. This project is designed to support heuristic signal generation, indicator calculation, and historical backtesting â€“ all with an easy-to-deploy structure.
