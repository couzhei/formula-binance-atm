### Placeholder Function

```python
def calculate_indicator_signals(df, indicator_name, variables, detect_divergence=False):
    """
    Calculate indicator values and signals for a given indicator and update the dataframe accordingly.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        The input price DataFrame with at least ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume'] columns.
    indicator_name : str
        The name of the indicator to calculate. For example: "MACD", "RSI", "STOCHRSI".
    variables : dict
        A dictionary of parameters specific to the chosen indicator. For example:
        {
            "fast_length": 12,
            "slow_length": 26,
            "signal_length": 9
        } for MACD.
    detect_divergence : bool, optional
        If True, attempt to detect divergences. Default is False.
    
    Returns
    -------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        The updated DataFrame with new columns for the calculated indicator and possibly signals.
    signals : dict
        A dictionary containing computed signals and information. For example:
        {
            "indicator": "MACD",
            "last_value": 0.03,
            "divergence_detected": True,
            "side": "BUY" or None
        }
    
    Notes
    -----
    This is a placeholder function. The idea is to:
    1. Identify which indicator is requested by `indicator_name`.
    2. Apply the corresponding calculation to `df`.
    3. Update `df` with new columns representing the indicator values.
    4. If `detect_divergence` is True, perform divergence detection and update `signals`.
    5. Return a structured `signals` dict with relevant info for strategy logic.
    
    You can easily add more indicators by extending the logic for each `indicator_name`.
    """
    # Initialize the signals dictionary
    signals = {"indicator": indicator_name, "divergence_detected": False, "side": None}

    if indicator_name == "MACD":
        # For MACD:
        # variables might contain: fast_length, slow_length, signal_length
        fast_length = variables.get("fast_length", 12)
        slow_length = variables.get("slow_length", 26)
        signal_length = variables.get("signal_length", 9)
        
        # TODO: Implement MACD calculation.
        # Example (pseudo-code):
        # line, signal_line, histogram = macd(df["Close"], slow_length, fast_length, signal_length)
        # df["MACD_line"] = line
        # df["MACD_signal"] = signal_line
        # df["MACD_hist"] = histogram
        # signals["last_value"] = histogram.iloc[-1]
        
        # If detect_divergence:
        #   Perform divergence detection and update signals["divergence_detected"] and signals["side"]
        pass

    elif indicator_name == "RSI":
        # For RSI:
        # variables might contain: length
        length = variables.get("length", 14)
        
        # TODO: Implement RSI calculation.
        # rsi_series = rsi(df["Close"], length)
        # df["RSI"] = rsi_series
        # signals["last_value"] = rsi_series.iloc[-1]
        
        # If detect_divergence:
        #   Check for RSI divergence
        pass

    # Add more indicators here (STOCHRSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.)...

    return df, signals
```

### Example of Using the Placeholder Function

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assume df is a DataFrame with OHLC data:
# columns: ["Date", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume"]
df = pd.read_csv("historical_data.csv")

# Example: Calculate MACD signals
macd_vars = {
    "fast_length": 12,
    "slow_length": 26,
    "signal_length": 9
}
df, macd_signals = calculate_indicator_signals(df, "MACD", macd_vars, detect_divergence=True)
print("MACD Signals:", macd_signals)

# Example: Calculate RSI signals without divergence detection
rsi_vars = {
    "length": 14
}
df, rsi_signals = calculate_indicator_signals(df, "RSI", rsi_vars, detect_divergence=False)
print("RSI Signals:", rsi_signals)
```

### Generating Signals for a Strategy

Once you have the indicators calculated, you can apply simple logic to generate buy/sell signals. For instance:

```python
def generate_signals(df):
    """
    Example strategy:
    - If RSI < 30 and MACD histogram > 0 => Buy signal
    - If RSI > 70 and MACD histogram < 0 => Sell signal
    """
    buy_signals = []
    sell_signals = []

    for i in range(len(df)):
        # Hypothetical example:
        if i < 1:
            continue
        rsi_value = df.get("RSI", [None])[i]
        macd_hist = df.get("MACD_hist", [None])[i]

        if rsi_value is not None and macd_hist is not None:
            if rsi_value < 30 and macd_hist > 0:
                buy_signals.append((df["Date"].iloc[i], df["Close"].iloc[i], "BUY"))
            elif rsi_value > 70 and macd_hist < 0:
                sell_signals.append((df["Date"].iloc[i], df["Close"].iloc[i], "SELL"))

    return buy_signals, sell_signals

buy_signals, sell_signals = generate_signals(df)
print("Buy Signals:", buy_signals)
print("Sell Signals:", sell_signals)
```

### Backtesting Example

To backtest, you would:

1. Run your indicator calculations and signal generation on historical data.
2. For each buy/sell signal, simulate trades, update the account balance, track profit/loss.

```python
def backtest_signals(df, buy_signals, sell_signals, initial_balance=10000):
    balance = initial_balance
    position = None

    for date, price, signal in sorted(buy_signals + sell_signals, key=lambda x: x[0]):
        if signal == "BUY" and position is None:
            # Buy 1 unit
            position = (price, date)
        elif signal == "SELL" and position is not None:
            # Sell 1 unit
            buy_price, _ = position
            profit = price - buy_price
            balance += profit
            position = None

    if position is not None:
        # If still holding at the end, close at last candle price
        last_price = df["Close"].iloc[-1]
        buy_price, _ = position
        balance += last_price - buy_price

    return balance

final_balance = backtest_signals(df, buy_signals, sell_signals, initial_balance=10000)
print("Final Balance after Backtest:", final_balance)
```

### Documentation and Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
   Write unit tests for `calculate_indicator_signals` to ensure it correctly calculates indicators given known inputs.
- **Integration Tests**:
   Test `generate_signals` and `backtest_signals` with small synthetic datasets to ensure signals and P/L calculations work as expected.

**Docstring and Markdown Documentation:**

You can create a `README.md` or `docs/` folder with Markdown files explaining:

1. How to install dependencies (`pip install ...`).
2. How to run the code (`python script.py`).
3. Explanation of each function:
   - `calculate_indicator_signals`: explains how to add new indicators and what arguments it needs.
   - `generate_signals`: how it uses indicators to create simple trading signals.
   - `backtest_signals`: how to simulate trading based on generated signals.
4. Examples of extending `calculate_indicator_signals` with new indicators like Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.

------

This setup provides a clean, modular approach:

- **`calculate_indicator_signals`**: central place to handle indicators.
- **Heuristic + minimal OpenAI calls**: first try heuristic classification, if uncertain, ask OpenAI to guess the category based on top text.
- **`generate_signals`**: separate simple strategy logic from indicator calculation.
- **`backtest_signals`**: test how signals would have performed historically.

By following this structure and expanding on the placeholder function, you can test and generate signals more effectively and integrate backtesting easily.
